He has an older brother, Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna.[10] Kohli's formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. He commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti Public School.[11] According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat and request his father bowl to him.</p>
    <p>In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) was created. On 30 May of that year, Prem Nath Kohli arranged for his son to meet Rajkumar Sharma.[13] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more than just playing in gully cricket.[14] Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of being unable to secure a place in the under-14 Delhi team, supposedly due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli reportedly received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would have ensured his selection, but he declined the proposals. Kohli eventually found his way into the under-15 Delhi team.[15] He received training at the academy while simultaneously participating in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave.[16] In pursuit of furthering his cricketing career, he transitioned to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education.</p>

    <h5>Comparisons to Sachin Tendulkar</h5>
    <p>Kohli's batting style and approach to the game have frequently drawn comparisons to Sachin Tendulkar, whom he regarded as the epitome of excellence in the sport of cricket. Dubbed as Tendulkar's "successor",[20][21] he is widely considered to have the potential to surpass his records in the future.[22][23] Kohli has stated that he tried to mirror Tendulkar's style of batting, imitating his shots and attempting to hit sixes in a similar manner.[24] Kohli's aggressive and dynamic style has earned him accolades from cricketing greats such as Vivian Richards, who has acknowledged Kohli's similarities to his own playing style.[25] He has been lauded as the "new king of world cricket" by Dean Jones, a former Australian cricketer.[26] While Indian commentator Aakash Chopra has noted that Tendulkar possessed a broader array of shots,[27] Kohli's skills with the bat have earned him accolades from former West Indies great Brian Lara, who has ranked him among the best batsmen in the world alongside Joe Root, the England captain at the time.</p>
    <p>In a discourse with Bollywood actor Salman Khan, Tendulkar proclaimed that Kohli possesses the potential to surpass his record of 100 international centuries. Tendulkar also acknowledged Kohli's batting aptitudes and the steadfastness with which he has accumulated runs.[29] In 2013, Tendulkar retired from international cricket, marking the end of an era for Indian cricket.

    <h6>Playing style</h6>
    <p>Kohli possesses technical abilities and a dynamic playing demeanour.[32][33] His customarily batting position in ODl cricket is at number three, with a slightly open-chested stance,[34] and a grip on the bottom handle of his bat. He has been noted for his agile footwork, expansive range of strokes, and his propensity for adeptly orchestrating innings whilst thriving in high-pressure situations.[35][36] In his batting technique, Kohli tends to favour playing grounded shots rather than attempting big hits. He is appreciated for his ability to execute wrist shots and his consistent prowess in the mid-wicket and cover region.</p>
    <p>Kohli has often expressed his admiration for the cover drive, which he considers to be his signature stroke. He uses the flick shot, particularly when facing deliveries aimed towards leg stump.[12] Having a limited recourse to the sweep shot, Kohli's batting technique is characterized by an emphasis on ground shots that primarily yield runs in the regions between deep square leg and mid-on.[39] Kohli scores runs between long-off and long-on with an aligned bat. His combination of bat-speed and supple wrist movements enable him to craft innovative angles that disrupt traditional field positioning.[40] Kohli is also a proficient fielder.</p>
    <p>However, Kohli has a vulnerability to deliveries that are wide of the off-stump.[42] Bowlers often exploit this weakness by targeting him with such deliveries, especially in Test and ODl matches.[43][44][45] Cricket experts such as VVS Laxman and former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar have acknowledged this weakness,[46][47] and former New Zealand cricketer Richard Hadlee has also noted that Kohli is particularly susceptible to out-swinging deliveries.</p>
    <h6>Aggression</h6>
    <p>Kohli's playing style is aggressive, a trait that extends to his leadership on the field.[57][58] His captaincy is characterized as proactive, taking decisions and leading the team by example.[59] Kohli has been the subject of much media scrutiny and criticism in the early stages of his career. He was often portrayed as a brash and arrogant individual, eliciting mixed reactions.[60][61] While some have praised his assertiveness and confidence,[62][63] others have criticized Kohli's behaviour for crossing the boundaries of fair play and for losing control, sometimes resulting in a loss of composure.[64] Despite his efforts to curb his aggressive behaviour, Kohli has acknowledged that there are times when intense pressure or high-stakes situations may challenge his resolve. The cricketer has persistently maintained that his aggression acts as a source of inspiration and drives his focus and motivation on the field.[65] Writing for The New York Times, Huw Richards noted Kohli's self-assuredness and "assertiveness" in contrast to some former Indian cricketers who he felt had exhibited an inclination towards excessive politeness and reticence, and that Kohli embodies his combative demeanour both on and off the cricket field.</p>
